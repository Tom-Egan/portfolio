    <h3 class="neg-mb-10">Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>This project focused on redefining how global vehicle controls are accessed and used, integrating into  a highly constrained automotive infotainment system. Working across UX, research, and engineering, I helped explore and evaluate multiple interaction models, balancing usability, safety, and platform consistency. The outcome established scalable interaction patterns that shipped on the 24MY Range Rover Velar and rolled out to all JLR  vehicle programs.</p>

    <p class="mb-60 italic"><strong>Expectations: </strong>This case study highlights UX and interaction design decisions under constraints, rather than final, highly polished visual design.</p>

    <h3>Design Impact</h3>
    <ul class="mt-20 neg-ml-24 mb-60">
      <li><strong>Platform Scalability: </strong>Created a shared interaction model for global controls, used across all  vehicle programs and multiple vehicle configurations</li>
      <li><strong>Risk Management: </strong>Helped align UX, engineering, and management on interaction tradeoffs early, reducing late-stage rework</li>
      <li><strong>Pioneering:</strong> Established a design precedent within JLR, backed by research, for touchscreen-based climate and vehicle controls</li>

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>For the 24MY (2024 Model Year) mid-cycle refresh, Jaguar Land Rover removed a number of physical controls as part of a redesigned interior approach. This resulted in several mission-critical vehicle functions needing to be safely and intuitively relocated into the touchscreen.</p>

        <p>As part of a small UX design team, I contributed to re-architecting the existing Pivi infotainment system, adhering to strict legal, functional, and development constraints. Through multiple design iterations, interactive prototypes, and user tests, we delivered a production-ready solution that launched on the Range Rover Velar and later scaled across all JLR vehicles for 24MY and beyond.</p>

        <h2>Constraints</h2>

         <p>The primary design challenge was working within a tightly constrained solution space. Design exploration was focused within system sidebars and overlays, shaped by platform constraints, regulatory considerations, and the existing infotainment architecture. These constraints defined the boundaries of the work and shaped which interaction patterns were viable.</p>

          <ul class="neg-ml-40 style-list">
              <li><strong>Functional: </strong>Mission-critical systems such as climate and drive modes needed to be globally accessible in the system (i.e. can be accessed at any time, regardless of which screen the user is on). In certain system states (e.g. while Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is active), the sidebars would be the only global entry point for these features.</li>

              <li class="li-block"><strong>Legal: </strong>Functions such as Rear Defrost came with their own set of rules which needed to be considered and influenced their implementation.</li>

              <li class="li-block"><strong>Development: </strong>Integrating brand new, system level interactions into an existing software architecture meant that engineering feasibility and platform constraints influenced the final solution space.</li>

        <h3 class="mt-60 neg-mb-10">The What</h3>

        <p>A straightforward goal: Provide  quick access to these high priority use cases, formerly physical controls, through the vehicle's touchscreen.</p>

        <h3 class="mt-60 neg-mb-10">The Who</h3>

        <p>The work was shared between two designers, Mutlu Isik and myself, with each of us developing concepts in parallel before converging on a unified interaction model and design direction. We tackled feature sets one at a time in order to solve nuanced problems individually—such as temperature control behavior and climate layout— then integrated cohesively at a system level.</p>

        <h2>Role</h2>

         <p>I was responsible for end-to-end concept development within our feature areas, which included: <strong>wireframing, interaction design, high-fidelity prototyping, and research collaboration</strong>. I helped develop each of the interactive prototypes used in all user tests and worked directly with UX Researchers in both Portland and the UK to frame hypotheses, define user test plans, and refine designs post-testing.</p>

         <p>With the JLR headquarters located in England, and our satellite office in Portland, Oregon, this was a global effort that involved regular collaboration with management and stakeholders in the UK.</p>

             <p>The first major problem to address was sorting out what and where everything would go into the sidebar, which boiled down to: the number of elements that needed to be added, exceeded the available space. Once mandatory defrost controls were accounted for, prioritization decisions were made through cross-functional review, balancing user needs with system-level constraints.</p>

              <h3>Contextual Buttons</h3>
              <span>6.2</span>
            </div>

              <ul class="mt-40 style-list">
                   <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Available space in the sidebar was insufficient for all required controls.</li>

                    <li><strong>Solution: </strong>Introduced context-dependent buttons based on system state.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Enabled access to four high-priority features using only two sidebar positions, without increasing interaction depth.</li>
                </ul>

              <p>To address space constraints, we introduced context-dependent buttons that adapted based on system state. One example was consolidating the previously separate Home and Apps buttons into a single contextual control.</p>

                <ul class="mt-20">
                    <li>If the user is on the home screen, display a shortcut button to open the <strong>App Drawer</strong>.</li>

                    <li>If the user <strong>is not</strong> on the home screen, display a shortcut button to return <strong>Home</strong>.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="caption">Note: The App Drawer could still be accessed via swiping from the left edge as a secondary method (Not quite as discoverable as the dedicated button, but still an available option for the user).</p>

                <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_delete_homebtn.svg" alt="Wireframes showing the state change to the sidebar button when the user is on the home screen and when the user is not">

                <p>This approach was extended to the Phone shortcut. With Phone  deprioritized, left without a permanent sidebar element, two edge cases still required attention: returning to active calls and returning to CarPlay or Android Auto. In these states, the Media button temporarily became a shortcut back to the active call or phone projection interface. Because call audio would already be using the cabin speakers, Media access became unnecessary in that moment (i.e. show the user the right thing at the right time). This allowed four high-priority features to be served through two sidebar positions, freeing additional space without increasing interaction depth.</p>

                <img class="mb-40" loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_delete_activecall.svg" alt="Wireframes showing the state change to the sidebar button when the user is on an active phone call">

                <div class="neg-mb-10 radius-sm small-section-marker">
              <h3>Combo Defrost Button</h3>
              <span>6.3</span>
            </div>

                <ul class="mt-40 style-list">
                    <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Available space in the sidebar was insufficient for all required controls, one-touch activation of Rear Defrost legally required.</li>

                    <li><strong>Solution: </strong>Combine two related functions into a single switch, toggling between multiple modes.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Legal compliance maintained and enabled dual activation in a single press.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Another example of where creative problem solving became necessary was with the case of Rear Defrost and Heated Windshield. Functionally, these two features are related, in the sense that they both are turning on some sort of heated element in the glass. Given that, and the limited space in the sidebar, these two features seemed like logical candidates to pair together into one button. However, a regulatory requirement that Rear Defrost remain accessible within a single interaction presented a different challenge.</p>

                <p>Several concepts were explored to balance space efficiency with usability. Early directions revealed tradeoffs between interaction simplicity and compliance requirements, helping narrow toward a solution that satisfied both. The chosen direction was a toggle switch that cycles through multiple functional states, while still complying with the Rear Defrost legal requirement. Our solution also created a beneficial byproduct: activating two controls on at once, in a single button press.</p>

                <p>To reduce ambiguity, visual indicators were added to clearly distinguish front and rear control  states and to signal that this control behaved differently from standard sidebar navigation. The interaction also adapted based on vehicle trim level—defaulting to a simple Rear Defrost toggle when Heated Windshield was not equipped.</p>

              <h3>Overlays</h3>

                <ul class="mt-40 style-list">
                    <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Broader feature sets needed quick access and to be globally accessible from any screen.</li>

                    <li><strong>Solution: </strong>Use sidebar buttons as entry points to open an overlay, to allow for full-screen display.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Additional Climate, Volume, and driving-related controls accessible from any screen, reduced visual clutter during active overlays.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="mb-40">Using sidebar buttons as overlay entry points introduced the risk of mixed interaction models within the same visual grouping. This was mitigated by clearly delineating interaction zones and reinforcing behavior through distinct visual treatments and affordances.</p>

                <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_delete_overlay1.png" alt="Annotated screenshot highlighting the visual cues that were added to the Overlay buttons">

                <p>Once an overlay is launched, the sidebars change to a more focused, empty state, removing unnecessary visual clutter. This was done to help communicate the context switch of having the overlay open, as well as provide the user a clearer visual path to their exit route (close button). One caveat to this strategy comes back to the previously mentioned legal requirements. Since one-touch activation of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost are required at all times, those two buttons needed to remain in place.</p>

                 <p>Introducing a secondary drag interaction to the overlay buttons enabled rapid adjustments, allowing for looser, less precise inputs from the user.  Visual feedback reinforced state changes without requiring explicit confirmation.</p>

                <p class="mb-40">To promote discoverability, a visual affordance—the Rail—was added to suggest a constrained drag interaction. Color cues reinforced directionality for temperature adjustment, and the same interaction model was later extended to Drive Modes and Volume for consistency.</p>

                <p class="mb-40">While our designated sandbox to design in was limited to the system sidebars and overlays, we were able to make one outside modification to  interaction model: a new home tile. The Preflight Checklist introduced a new "launch pad" or "start here" type of interaction pattern, allowing drivers to easily locate key system settings before starting their journey. This reduced the number of interactions and time spent wayfinding during vehicle startup. The primary goal behind this was to help ease the transition from physical controls to touchscreen by surfacing those frequently used functions at the top level. </p>

                <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Early Concepts</h4>
                <p class="mb-40">A concept of a modal window appearing once the system booted up had been explored initially. However, while this approach ensures visibility to the user, the major tradeoff is that it introduced additional friction by requiring an explicit decision from the user at each vehicle start. That friction could diminish the long term user experience over the product's lifespan and day-to-day use, resulting in a preference for the less intrusive implementation of a home tile. This exploration demonstrated a case of: execution negating the design intent and creating a potential pain point.</p>

             <p class="mb-40">The Climate Overlay was structured into three sections—temperature, seats, and fan speed—each optimized for its specific use case. While uniform control patterns were initially explored, testing showed that excessive visual repetition affected comprehension. Assigning distinct interaction styles to each section helped improved clarity.</p>

          <p class="mt-40">For temperature, a variety of controls were provided to cover a range of use cases: small, medium, and large adjustments.</p>

          <ul class="style-list">
              <li><strong>Single Chevrons: </strong>adjusts the temperature up/down by one degree (0.5 degrees  Celsius).</li>

              <li><strong>Double Chevrons: </strong>adjusts in larger chunks, changing the temperature up/down in four-degree increments (two degrees Celsius).</li>

              <li><strong>Hi/Lo: </strong>dedicated shortcuts to jump to the highest and lowest temperatures round out the suite of controls</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="mb-40">Supplemental interactions were also included: press-and-hold any of the chevrons for continuous adjustment, and dragging up/down on the entire temperature area.</p>

          <p>Moving over to Seats, this section is a small slice of a larger Seats app, providing quick access to the highest priority use case: seat heating/cooling. With a limited range of adjustments, we were able to display direct selection of high, medium, and low all at once, reducing the number of steps for the user. The visual centerpiece of the overlay, the seat graphic indicates which zone(s) heating/cooling is applied to. Finally, to increase user mobility around the system, a shortcut to the full Seats app (which includes additional features such as Massage) anchors the top edge of the screen. </p>

          <p class="mb-40">The final section of the Climate Overlay contains the fan speed controls. Placement of this section in the overlay was very deliberate. Being the only "neutral" or shared control, it serves as a natural divider and visual break when both the driver and passenger Climate Overlays are open at the same time. Interactions for fan speed are fairly straightforward: direct selection via press or dragging. Similarly to Seats, a shortcut to the wider Climate app is provided above.</p>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Early Concepts</h4>
          
          <p>Early concepts shown below are exploratory and were used to evaluate interaction models and layout behavior rather than final visual design. A range of layout and control variations were explored to understand how visual density, grouping, and interaction patterns affected comprehension and usability. These explorations informed the final structure by clarifying which approaches improved clarity and which introduced unnecessary complexity.</p>

          <p class="mb-40"> A few of the early challenges included finding a balance of: clear delineation of content buckets, managing independent passenger controls, visual overload, control blindness (i.e. similar elements blending together from duplication in close proximity), and visual hierarchy.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_concept6.png" alt="Image of an early design concept for the Vehicle Controls overlay">
            <p class="caption mb-40 mt-0">Early concept utilizing a more uniform and symmetrical grid, with section labels doubling as shortcuts to open the associated app. This layout structure limited options in terms of the interactions which could be used, given the smaller available space.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_concept7.png" alt="Image of an early design concept for the Vehicle Controls overlay">
            <p class="caption mb-40 mt-0">Exploration of alternative control schemes that enabled more precision and direct selections, experimenting with  asymmetrical visual hierarchy to separate content blocks. This approach presented design tradeoffs of increasing usability, at the cost of visual density.</p>

          <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_concept9.png" alt="Image of an early design concept for the Vehicle Controls overlay">
            <p class="caption mb-60 mt-0">Shared, bottom drawer concept with pagination, swiping to access controls for different feature areas such as Seats. Ultimately, this represented a divergent interaction model of a shared space between driver and passenger, creating conflicts with how the other overlays behave (e.g. duplicate entry points).</p>

          <div class="neg-mb-10 radius-sm small-section-marker">
              <h3>Vehicle Controls</h3>
              <span>7.2</span>
            </div>

            <p>From an information architecture perspective, this was the largest and most complex feature area. Managing the selection of a large number of different drive modes was the first major challenge. Since the Pivi system already had a dedicated off-road app (4x4i), the approach was the surface the drive modes for everyday use in this top-level overlay, and defer the more situational, off-road modes to the 4x4i app. Doing so reduced some of complexity within the overlay and eliminated unnecessary visual clutter with lower frequency use cases.</p>

            <p class="mb-40">Because the scope of features within this overlay was particularly broad and varied  vehicle-to-vehicle, similar controls/features were grouped into tiles, presented as a scrollable list. </p>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Early Concepts</h4>
          
          <p>Early design concepts for Vehicle Controls included a condensed, half-screen overlay, as well as alternative layouts and navigation methods. Some early explorations experimented with translating familiar physical controls into digital equivalents, with the hypothesis that a level of muscle memory would carryover to a touchscreen environment. Surfacing contextually relevant controls of the selected drive mode and helpful descriptions were additional aspects explored as well.</p>
          <p class="mb-40">Layout-wise, there was a focus to keep the three different overlays structured similarly—e.g. mapping a full-height column next to the sidebar for the element that the Quick Slider would be controlling. A few examples of these early concepts are highlighted below.</p>

           <img loading="lazy" src="../img/jlr/icp_concept1.png" alt="Image of an early design concept for the Vehicle Controls overlay">
            <p class="caption mb-40 mt-0">Early concept using accordion menus to separate out the supplemental vehicle controls and to reduce visual density. This example also highlights the use of surfacing contextually relevant controls, such as the Wade Sensing feature to view water depth when Wade mode is selected.</p>

            <p class="caption mb-40 mt-0">Repackaging the above concept into a half-screen overlay and adding pagination, swiping to access the quick controls. This concept also explored the idea of providing an explicit signpost and entry point into Terrain Response (off-road modes), emphasizing the brand's capabilities. Early explorations favored limiting overlays to half-screen, as to not interfere with the passenger Climate overlay.</p>
