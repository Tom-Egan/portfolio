        <h2>Context</h2>
        <p>On the weekends, I work as the photographer for two local dirt tracks—placing me directly inside the racing environment and community. This proximity opened up opportunities to support both the track and it's drivers with design needs extending beyond photography.</p>

        <ul class="style-list italic">
            <li><strong>Portfolio relevancy: </strong>These opportunities provided me with a live, production context to practice and develop complementary skills alongside my day-to-day UX work.

These promotions presented a challenge in terms of, <span class="italic">where to draw the line</span>, with information density and needing quick turnaround times. The  weekly feedback loop of these promotions inadvertently turned into UX/usability testing in way for me—being able to see what kind of questions were being asked in the comments—helping me determine priority, hierarchy, and what didn't work going forward.</p>

          <p>Hero cards offer a touchpoint between drivers and fans—a piece of memoriabilia to sign autographs onto and a marketing tool for drivers. These hero cards gave drivers a professional, recognizable presence while remaining visually aligned with the paint/color scheme associated with their racecar. While not a digital product, elements of UX design still apply—particularly when considering how and where autographs would appear during real-world use.</p>

          <p class="mb-40">The particular example below highlights a color-matched palette to the racecar's paint scheme. This example also features a  custom, "Bad Bob" logo, which is based off  design elements from the racecar.</p>

          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Optimized for short-form, vertical-first social platforms.</h4>

          <p>Extending my racing photography into behind-the-scenes, short-form, and social content, I applied my background in After Effects to create a "behind the lens" series using GoPro footage. This series allowed me to expand my personal brand in new ways, presenting photography from a different angle that is tailored to the video-prioritized algorithms of modern social media.</p>

          <p class="mb-60">The selected examples below showcase elements of 2D motion graphics, shape morphs, 3D camera and lighting animation, 3D camera tracking, rotoscoping, and visual effects.</p>


          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Title Sequence 1—Series & Episode Reveal</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">The opening segment layers elements in Z-space to setup a moment of tension—positioning the 6 close to the camera, creating a shallow depth-of-field effect. Looking through a gap in the number, an animated spotlight illuminates the title text that lies behind, before pulling the camera back to reveal the episode number.</p>

            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip1.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Title Sequence 2—Location Reveal</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">Accent lines enter behind the subject, drawing attention towards the next scene unfolding in the background. The scene continues with the lines morphing into the characters of the next title sequence. A forest flythrough is used to create a sense of world-building and establish environment. Expanding circles follow to help pull focus towards the title text and setup the next object transition.</p>

          <div class="img-grid mb-80">
            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip2.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Title Sequence 3—Transition to Footage</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">The circles from the previous segment collapse inward to both clear the title text and setup an object morph into the state of Oregon shape. From here, a pin of where the track is located on the map is used to setup the transition into a satellite zoom-in on the track, ending the intro and establishing the start of video footage.</p>

          <div class="img-grid mb-80">
            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip3.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Rotoscoping</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">Multiple instances of rotoscoping and masking were used to help pull focus on both the car and highlight the wall—acting as a foreshadowing element for what the upcoming photo will look like. I.e. framing the video as the photo will appear, replicating my perspective behind the camera.</p>

          <div class="img-grid mb-80">
            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip4.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">3D Camera Tracker Transition</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">Up to this point in the video, all footage took place from a location outside of the track. To setup the location change of where the remaining video footage/photos took place (down on the infield of the racetrack), another satellite transition clip was inserted. This highlights to the viewer where the camera will be heading towards next.</p>

          <div class="img-grid mb-80">
            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip5.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
          </div>

          <h4 class="neg-mb-20">Transition to Outro & Logo Reveal</h4>

          <p class="mb-20">Connecting back into elements of my personal photography logo, which includes the corners of a camera viewfinder, the final image is scaled down, revealing those same viewfinder elements. Those same corner elements are then used to morph into my logo reveal, ending the video footage and starting the outro.</p>

          <div class="img-grid mb-80">
            <video loading="lazy" muted controls autoplay loop src="../img/dirt_track/dirtcoatedlens_clip6.mp4">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video>
