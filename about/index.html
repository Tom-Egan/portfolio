          I’m a UX Designer focused on creating clear, intuitive digital experiences in complex environments. My work spans interaction design, systems thinking, and visual craft.
        </p>

        <p>
        Originally from the Upper Midwest, I was born and raised in Minnesota and studied Media Arts & Game Development at the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater. Since 2016, I’ve been based in St. Helens, Oregon, where I work as a UX Designer for Jaguar Land Rover, contributing to in-vehicle infotainment systems used across global vehicle platforms.

        Outside of my day-to-day work, I’m deeply involved in the local dirt track racing community as a photographer and designer. Through <a class="serif-strong" href="https://www.tomeganphoto.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Egan Photo</a>, I collaborate with tracks and drivers on race promotions, driver promotions, and more—an outlet that lets me explore storytelling and visual design work in a real-world setting.
