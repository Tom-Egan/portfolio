                    <p>Following the 20MY (2020 Model Year) launch of the new Pivi/Pivi Pro infotainment system in JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) vehicles, came the 24MY mid-cycle refresh. The proposed  update for 24MY included reconfigured vehicle interiors with several physical controls and switchpacks removed.</p>

                    <p>Our team was tasked with designing a solution around relocating those affected features, previously physical controls, into the vehicle's touchscreen. After several design iterations, interactive prototypes,  and user tests, our team delivered the design solution that made it into the 24MY production vehicles. This UX (user experience) update to the infotainment system eventually cascaded down into all JLR vehicles for 24MY and beyond.

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The primary design challenge was that the sandbox we were given to design a solution in, was limited to the system sidebars and system overlays. This constraint came from points of functional requirements, legal requirements, and software development:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Functional: </strong>Mission-critical systems such as climate and drive modes needed to be globally accessible in the system (i.e. can be accessed at anytime, regardless of which screen the user is on). In certain system states (e.g. while Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is active), the sidebars would be the only globally available entry point for these features.</li>
                    <li class="li-block"><strong>Legal: </strong>Functions such as Rear Defrost came with their own set of rules which needed to be considered and also dictated their implementation.</li>
                    <li class="li-block"><strong>Development: </strong>Integrating brand new, system level interactions into an existing software architecture meant that time and cost to develop factored into how much the system could/should be modified.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With this project occuring during the 2020 COVID pandemic, user testing challenges for our concepts also came into play. The inability to conduct user test sessions in-person and in-vehicle with participants meant that we would need to find alternative methods.

                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>The concept work was split up between a team of two designers, myself included, where we decided to tackle individual feature sets, one at a time before piecing it together into a larger interaction model. Reason being, this would be the first time these functions would be performed on the touchscreen in JLR vehicles - resulting in a lot of individual nuance to sort out (e.g. solving the temperature control interactions, then solving the broader layout of the whole climate screen).
                </p>

                <p>A breakdown of our design iteration cycle included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design two, contrasting concepts (in Sketch/Figma)</li>
                    <li>Develop those two design concepts into two interactive prototypes (in Proto.io)</li>
                    <li>Pre user test: Coordinate with our Portland UX Research team
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine interactions/user flows to examine</li>
                            <li>Define the user test tasks</li>
                            <li>Conduct remote, A/B test of the two prototypes (via Microsoft Teams)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Post user test: Review with our Portland UX Research team
                        <ul>
                            <li>User test insights, recommendations, and next steps</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Take the research recommendations and insights and return to Step 1 with a refined design direction</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each of the feature sets went through several of these design iteration cycles before putting it all together into a single design proposal. Later on, more extensive and comprehensive user testing of the prototype was conducted by our research team in the UK - performed on the JLR test track in Gaydon, England.</p>

                    <h3>Sidebar Layout</h3>
                    <p>Starting first with the driver sidebar layout—after accounting for the placement of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost (legal requirements), many back-and-forth dicussions of which features to prioritize unfolded. It became a matter of, the number of elements that needed to be added, exceeded the available space. </p>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_sidebar.svg">

                    <h3>Contextual Buttons</h3>

                    <p>One solution to this problem was to introduce the idea of  context-dependent buttons. Meaning, elements would change depending on the context or screen the user is on. For example, in the first version of Pivi for 20MY-23MY, there were two separate buttons for Home and Apps. With space being at an all-time premium in the 24MY update, those two buttons were consolidated down into one contextual button:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user is on the home screen, display a shortcut button to open the App Drawer.</li>
                        <li>If the user is <strong>not</strong> on the home screen, display a shortcut button to return Home.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_homebtn.svg">

                    <p>This same idea was also applied to the Phone shortcut. As one of the  deprioritized features, Phone no longer had a permanent shortcut in the sidebar. Some might ask, "but what if the user is on a phone call?" Similarly, in that context of being on an active phone call, the Media button would temporarily change to a shortcut to return to the active call screen. Given that the phone call audio would be coming through the cabin speakers, this made access to Media unncessary at that point in time. With this approach we were effectively able to serve up shortcuts to four features, freeing up two available slots in the sidebar.</p>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_activecall.svg">

                     <h3>Combo Defrost Button</h3>
                     <p>Another example of where creative problem solving became necessary was with the case of Rear Defrost and Heated Windshield. Functionally, these two features are related, in the sense that they both are turning on some sort of heated element in the glass. Given that, and the limited space in the sidebar, these two features seemed like logical candidates to pair together into one button. However, the legal requirement that was given to us—at any point, Rear Defrost must be able to be turned on within one press on the screen—presented a different challenge. After several different design concepts and user tests, the final result was a toggle switch that cycles through four different states, while satisfying the Rear Defrost legal requirement.</p>

                     <ul>
                         <li><strong>Button State 1:</strong> Off</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 2:</strong> Rear Defrost on</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 3:</strong> Heated Windshield on</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 4:</strong> Rear Defrost + Heated Windshield on </li>
                     </ul>

                     <h3>Climate Overlay</h3>

                     <h3>Drive Modes Overlay</h3>

                     <h3>The Quick Slider</h3>
