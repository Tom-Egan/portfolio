                    <p>Following the 20MY (2020 Model Year) launch of the new Pivi/Pivi Pro infotainment system in JLR (Jaguar Land Rover) vehicles, came the 24MY mid-cycle refresh. The proposed  update for 24MY, L560 Range Rover Velar being the lead vehicle for this update, included reconfigured vehicle interiors with several physical controls and switchpacks removed.</p>

                    <p>Our team was tasked with designing a solution around relocating those affected features, previously physical controls, into the vehicle's touchscreen. After several design iterations, interactive prototypes,  and user tests, our team delivered the design solution that made it into the 24MY production vehicles. This UX (user experience) update to the infotainment system eventually cascaded down into all JLR vehicles for 24MY and beyond.

                    <p>The primary design challenge was that the sandbox we were given to design a solution in, was limited to the system sidebars and system overlays. This constraint came from points of functional requirements, legal requirements, and software development:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Functional: </strong>Mission-critical systems such as climate and drive modes needed to be globally accessible in the system (i.e. can be accessed at anytime, regardless of which screen the user is on). In certain system states (e.g. while Apple CarPlay or Android Auto is active), the sidebars would be the only global entry point for these features.</li>
                    <li class="li-block"><strong>Legal: </strong>Functions such as Rear Defrost came with their own set of rules which needed to be considered and also dictated their implementation.</li>
                    <li class="li-block"><strong>Development: </strong>Integrating brand new, system level interactions into an existing software architecture meant that time and cost to develop factored into how much the system could/should be modified.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>With this project occuring during the 2020 COVID pandemic, user testing challenges for our concepts also came into play. The inability to conduct user test sessions in-person and in-vehicle with participants meant that we would need to find alternative methods.

                    <h3>The What</h3>

                    <p>A straightforward goal: Provide  quick access to these high priority use cases, formerly physical controls.</p>

                    <h3>The Who</h3>
                    <p>The concept work was split up between a team of two designers, Mutlu Isik and myself, where we decided to tackle individual feature sets, one at a time before piecing it together into a larger interaction model. Reason being, this would be the first time these functions would be performed on the touchscreen in JLR vehicles - resulting in a lot of individual nuance to sort out (e.g. solving the temperature control interactions, then solving the broader layout of the whole climate screen).</p>

                <h3>The How</h3>
                <p>A breakdown of our design iteration cycle included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Design two, contrasting concepts (in Sketch/Figma)</li>
                    <li>Develop those two design concepts into two interactive prototypes (in Proto.io)</li>
                    <li>Pre user test: Coordinate with our Portland UX Research team
                        <ul>
                            <li>Determine interactions/user flows to examine</li>
                            <li>Define the user test tasks and user test plan</li>
                            <li>Conduct remote, A/B tests of the two prototypes (via Microsoft Teams)</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Post user test: Review with our Portland UX Research team
                        <ul>
                            <li>User test insights, recommendations, and next steps</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Run it again: Take the research recommendations and insights and return to Step 1 with a refined design direction</li>
                </ol>

                <p>Each of the feature sets went through several of these design iteration cycles before putting it all together into a single design proposal. More extensive and comprehensive user testing of the prototype was also conducted by our research team in the UK - performed on the JLR test track in Gaydon, England.</p>

                <p>With the JLR headquarters located in England, and our satellite office in Portland, Oregon, this was a global effort that involved regular collaboration with management and stakeholders in the UK.</p>

                    <h3>Sidebar Layout</h3>
                    <p>Starting first with the driver sidebar layout—after accounting for the placement of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost (legal requirements), many back-and-forth dicussions of which features to prioritize unfolded. It became a matter of, the number of elements that needed to be added, exceeded the available space. </p>

                     <img src="../img/icp_delete_sidebar_callout.png">
                    

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_sidebar.svg">

                    <h3>Contextual Buttons</h3>

                    <p>One solution to this problem was to introduce the idea of  context-dependent buttons. Meaning, elements would change depending on the context or screen the user is on. For example, in the first version of Pivi for 20MY-23MY, there were two separate buttons for Home and Apps. With space being at an all-time premium in the 24MY update, those two buttons were merged together into one contextual button:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>If the user is on the home screen, display a shortcut button to open the App Drawer.</li>
                        <li>If the user is <strong>not</strong> on the home screen, display a shortcut button to return Home.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Note: The App Drawer could still be accessed via swiping from the left edge as a secondary method (Not quite as discoverable as the dedicated button, but still an available option for the user).

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_homebtn.svg">

                    <p>This same idea was also applied to the Phone shortcut. As one of the  deprioritized features, Phone no longer had a permanent shortcut in the sidebar. Some might ask, "but what if the user is on a phone call?" Similarly, in that context of being on an active phone call, the Media button would temporarily change to a shortcut to return to the active call screen. Given that the phone call audio would be coming through the cabin speakers, this made access to Media unncessary at that point in time—i.e. show the user the right thing at the right time. With this approach we were effectively able to serve up shortcuts to four features in two areas, freeing up two available slots in the sidebar.</p>

                    <p>Note: This same concept would also apply in the scenarios when CarPlay or Android Auto is connected, as they now become the media source.</p>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_activecall.svg">

                     <h3>Combo Defrost Button</h3>
                     <p>Another example of where creative problem solving became necessary was with the case of Rear Defrost and Heated Windshield. Functionally, these two features are related, in the sense that they both are turning on some sort of heated element in the glass. Given that, and the limited space in the sidebar, these two features seemed like logical candidates to pair together into one button. However, the legal requirement that was given to us—at any point, Rear Defrost must be able to be turned on within one press on the screen—presented a different challenge.</p>
                    <p>After several different design concepts and user tests, the final result was a toggle switch that cycles through four different states, while still satisfying the Rear Defrost legal requirement. Doing so also gave us the benefit of saving an interaction—the ability to turn two controls on at once, in a single button press.</p>
                    <ul>
                         <li><strong>Button State 1:</strong> Off</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 2:</strong> Rear Defrost + Heated Windshield on</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 3:</strong> Heated Windshield on</li>
                         <li><strong>Button State 4:</strong> Rear Defrost on </li>
                     </ul>

                    <p>Additional design notes—Because of the visual similarity between the two icons, F (front) and R (rear) indicators were added next to the icons. Visual reinforcement in the form of dedicated status indicators (dots) were added as well, so that the  user could better differentiate which of the two is turned on and differentiate the button's intent (i.e. it now looks different than the Navigation shortcut button, so the user should expect it to behave differently). This combo button is also dependent on vehicle trim level, if Heated Windshield is not equipped then this becomes a simple on/off button for Rear Defrost.</p>

                     

                     <img src="../img/icp_delete_defrost.svg">

                     <h3>Overlays</h3>

                     <p>Accessed from the sidebars, overlays were used to accommdate  more complex and deeper feature sets, such as Climate and Drive Modes. This however, created it's own set of design challenges as now there was less consistency with how the sidebars behave—it became a mixed bag of interactions. In other words: certain buttons performed an on/off action, some buttons exit your current screen and take you somewhere new, and some keep you in the same context but display an overlay on top. It's debatable if that is actually a problem in  itself. However, the problem occurs when it breaks the mental model of: things that look similar, should function similar (especially when grouped in close proximity).</p>

                    <p>To assist the user in identify the different intents of these buttons, or at least, tip the user off that if you press this, something different will happen, specific visual styling was applied to the overlay buttons. This was done for two reason: One, to indicate to the user that these buttons behave differently that the rest of the sidebar buttons. Two, the button could be repurposed, changing context to a close button once the overlay was opened.</p>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_overlay1.png">

                    


                    <p>Once an overlay is launched, the sidebars change to a more focused, empty state, removing unnecessary visual clutter. This was done to help communicate the context switch of having the overlay open, as well as provide the user a clearer visual path to their exit route (close button). One caveat to this stategy comes back to the previously mentioned legal requirements. Since one-touch activation of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost are required at all times, those two buttons needed to remain in place.</p>

                    <h3>The Quick Slider</h3>
                    <p>Maximizing our design sandbox and to enable "no-look" or muscle-memory interactions while driving, secondary interactions were designed into the overlay buttons. In addition to  pressing the buttons (to open an overlay), a drag interaction was added for quick and wide-band adjustments. With the physical volume control removed and now living in the touchscreen, having the ability to make quick (and large) adjustments to the volume level became one use case that benefitted from this interaction.</p>

                    <p>To promote the discoverability of the drag interaction, a deliberate visual element and affordance was added to the button: The Rail. A line extending outwards from the button was used to create the impression of the button sitting on a track, appearing more as a draggable element. The Rail also provided an opportunity communicate interaction intent with the temperature slider. With the blue tip used to suggest  dragging down will lower the temperature, and the red tip, used to suggest a dragging up will raise the temperature.</p>

                    <img src="../img/icp_delete_therail.png">


                    <h3>Climate Overlay</h3>
                    <p>The Climate Overlay is broken up into three sections of controls: temperature, heated/cooled seats, and fan speed. Several different layouts and individual control styles were explored and tested, including concepts where all three sections reused the exact same format of controls. In those cases, the visual duplication and repetition became too much. In the end, each section was given control schemes that suited their use cases best. The visual variance of controls between sections enabled users quicker task completions.</p>

                    <p>For temperature, a variety of controls were provided to cover a range of use cases: small, medium, and large adjustments. (1) The single chevrons adjust the temperature up/down by one degree (0.5 degrees  Celsius). (2) Double chevrons adjust in larger chunks, changing the temperature up/down in five-degree increments (two degrees Celsius). (3) Dedicated shortcuts to jump to the highest and lowest temperatures round out the suite of controls. Supplemental interactions were also included: press-and-hold any of the chevrons for continunous adjustment, and dragging up/down on the entire temperature area.</p>

                    <p>Moving over to Seats, this section is a small slice of a larger Seats app, providing quick access to the highest priority use case: seat heating/cooling. With a limited range of adjustments, we were able to display direct selection of high, medium, and low all at once, reducing the number of steps for the user. The visual centerpiece of the overlay, the seat graphic doubles as an  interactive element - controlling which zone(s) heating/cooling is applied to. Finally, to increase user mobility around the system, a shortcut to the full Seats app (which includes additional features such as Massage) anchors the top edge of the screen. </p>

                    <p>The final section of the Climate Overlay contains the fan speed controls. Placement of this section in the overlay was very deliberate. Being the only "neutral" or shared control, it serves as a natural divider and visual break when both the driver and passsenger Climate Overlays are open at the same time. Interactions for fan speed are fairly straightforward: direct selection via press or dragging. Similarly to Seats, a shortcut to the wider Climate app is provided above.
