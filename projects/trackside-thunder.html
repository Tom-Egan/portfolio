            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p><strong>Trackside Thunder</strong> is an upcoming podcast, expected to launch in 2026. The name gives a nod to both the podcast’s subject matter, dirt track racing, and the show’s host — Thunder Jones, announcer for River City Speedway in St. Helens, Oregon.</p>

            <p>Starting from scratch, the goal was to create a brand that felt established from Day One — credible enough to stand alongside long-running motorsports media, while remaining flexible enough to grow into something bigger.</p>

            <ul class="style-list italic">
                <li><strong>Portfolio relevancy: </strong>While this project focused on brand identity rather than product UX, it required the same core skills that apply to UX design: systems thinking, scalability, constraint-based decision making, and designing for long-term use across multiple platforms.</li>
            </ul>

            <ul class="h3-list-margin">
                <li><strong>Be unique: </strong>Avoid generic podcast imagery, such as a microphone, and create something distinct and identifiable</li>

                <li><strong>Express personality: </strong>This isn’t a tech company, lean into the energy and charisma of dirt track racing</li>

                <li><strong>Merch-minded: </strong>Racing offers large marketing opportunities; easily translate to  clothing and promotional merchandise that could be showcased in a variety of ways at the racetrack</li>

                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong> By mapping out keywords and attributes associated to the brand/subject matter, design concepts can be connected back to a strategy, grounding design decisions to a targeted theme. </li>

            <p class="margin-10">
              This exercise helped narrow the brand keywords toward <strong>controlled chaos</strong> and <strong>storytelling</strong>, which later influenced the design direction of the wordmark and icon.

                <p>The first major problem to address was sorting out what and where everything would go into the sidebar, which boiled down to: the number of elements that needed to be added, exceeded the available space. Once  placement of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost (legal requirements) was  accounted for, many back-and-forth dicussions with manangement and stakeholders of which features to prioritize unfolded.</p>

                <ul>
                   <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Available space in the sidebar was insufficient for all required controls.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Enabled access to four high-priority features using only two sidebar positions, without increasing interaction depth.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-media">

                <p>To address space constraints, we introduced context-dependent buttons that adapted based on system state. One example was consolidating the previously separate Home and Apps buttons into a single contextual control.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>If the user is on the home screen, display a shortcut button to open the App Drawer.</li>

                    <li>If the user is not on the home screen, display a shortcut button to return Home.</li>
                </ul>

                <p class="img-buffer">Note: The App Drawer could still be accessed via swiping from the left edge as a secondary method (Not quite as discoverable as the dedicated button, but still an available option for the user).</p>

                <img loading="lazy" src="../img/icp_delete_homebtn.svg" alt="Wireframes showing the state change to the sidebar button when the user is on the home screen and when the user is not">

                <p class="img-buffer">This approach was extended to the Phone shortcut. With Phone  deprioritized, left without a permanent sidebar element, two edge cases still required attention: returning to active calls and returning to CarPlay or Android Auto. In these states, the Media button temporarily became a shortcut back to the active call or phone projection interface. Because call audio was already using the cabin speakers, Media access was unnecessary at that moment (i.e. show the user the right thing at the right time). This allowed four high-priority features to be served through two sidebar positions, freeing additional space without increasing interaction depth.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Available space in the sidebar was insufficient for all required controls, one-touch activation of Rear Defrost legally required.</li>

                    <li><strong>Solution: </strong>Combine two related functions into a single switch, toggling between multiple modes.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Legal compliance maintained and enabled dual activation in a single press.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="project-media">

                <p>Another example of where creative problem solving became necessary was with the case of Rear Defrost and Heated Windshield. Functionally, these two features are related, in the sense that they both are turning on some sort of heated element in the glass. Given that, and the limited space in the sidebar, these two features seemed like logical candidates to pair together into one button. However, the legal requirement that was given to us—at any point, Rear Defrost must be able to be turned on within one press on the screen—presented a different challenge.</p>

                <p>Several concepts were explored and ultimately rejected due to legal constraints requiring one-touch activation of Rear Defrost. The chosen direction was a toggle switch that cycles through four different states, while still complying with  the Rear Defrost legal requirement. Our solution also created a beneficial byproduct: activating two controls on at once, in a single button press.</p>

                <p class="img-buffer">To reduce ambiguity, visual indicators were added to clearly distinguish front and rear control  states and to signal that this control behaved differently from standard sidebar navigation. The interaction also adapted based on vehicle trim level—defaulting to a simple Rear Defrost toggle when Heated Windshield was not equipped.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Problem: </strong>Broader feature sets needed quick access and to be globally accessible from any screen.</li>

                    <li><strong>Solution: </strong>Use sidebar buttons as entry points to open an overlay, to allow for full-screen display.</li>

                    <li><strong>Impact: </strong>Climate, volume, and drive controls accessible from any screen, reduced visual clutter during active overlays.</li>

            <div class="project-media">

                <p class="img-buffer">Using sidebar buttons as overlay entry points introduced the risk of mixed interaction models within the same visual grouping. This was mitigated by clearly delineating interaction zones and reinforcing behavior through distinct visual treatments and affordances.</p>

                <img loading="lazy" src="../img/icp_delete_overlay1.png" alt="Annotated screenshot highlighting the visual cues that were added to the Overlay buttons">

                <p class="img-buffer">Once an overlay is launched, the sidebars change to a more focused, empty state, removing unnecessary visual clutter. This was done to help communicate the context switch of having the overlay open, as well as provide the user a clearer visual path to their exit route (close button). One caveat to this stategy comes back to the previously mentioned legal requirements. Since one-touch activation of Rear Defrost and Max Defrost are required at all times, those two buttons needed to remain in place.</p>

            <p class="img-buffer">The Climate Overlay was structured into three sections—temperature, seats, and fan speed—each optimized for its specific use case. While uniform control patterns were initially explored, testing showed that excessive visual repetition affected comprehension. Assigning distinct interaction styles to each section helped improved clarity.</p>

            <p>For temperature, a variety of controls were provided to cover a range of use cases: small, medium, and large adjustments.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Single Chevrons: </strong>adjusts the temperature up/down by one degree (0.5 degrees  Celsius).</li>

                <li><strong>Double Chevrons: </strong>adjusts in larger chunks, changing the temperature up/down in four-degree increments (two degrees Celsius).</li>

                <li><strong>Hi/Lo: </strong>dedicated shortcuts to jump to the highest and lowest temperatures round out the suite of controls</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="img-buffer">Supplemental interactions were also included: press-and-hold any of the chevrons for continuous adjustment, and dragging up/down on the entire temperature area.</p>

            <p>Moving over to Seats, this section is a small slice of a larger Seats app, providing quick access to the highest priority use case: seat heating/cooling. With a limited range of adjustments, we were able to display direct selection of high, medium, and low all at once, reducing the number of steps for the user. The visual centerpiece of the overlay, the seat graphic indicates which zone(s) heating/cooling is applied to. Finally, to increase user mobility around the system, a shortcut to the full Seats app (which includes additional features such as Massage) anchors the top edge of the screen. </p>

            <p class="img-buffer">The final section of the Climate Overlay contains the fan speed controls. Placement of this section in the overlay was very deliberate. Being the only "neutral" or shared control, it serves as a natural divider and visual break when both the driver and passsenger Climate Overlays are open at the same time. Interactions for fan speed are fairly straightforward: direct selection via press or dragging. Similarly to Seats, a shortcut to the wider Climate app is provided above.</p>
