            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <p><strong>Trackside Thunder</strong> is an upcoming podcast, expected to launch in 2026. The name gives a nod to both the podcast’s subject matter, dirt track racing, and the show’s host — Thunder Jones, announcer for River City Speedway in St. Helens, Oregon.</p>

            <p>Starting from scratch, the goal was to create a brand that felt established from Day One — credible enough to stand alongside long-running motorsports media, while remaining flexible enough to evolve as the podcast grows.</p>

            <ul class="style-list italic">
                <li><strong>Portfolio relevancy: </strong>While this project focused on brand identity rather than product UX, it relied on the same core skills: systems thinking, scalability, constraint-based decision making, and designing for long-term, multi-platform use.</li>
            </ul>

                <li><strong>Recognizable: </strong>Enable the brand to stand out in a memorable way and attract attention.</li>

                <li><strong>Brand depth: </strong>Visual components that can be used independently or arranged into multiple configurations and flavors.</li>

                <li><strong>Ready for success: </strong>Establish a professional presence at launch, equipped with the tools to grow once the podcast launches.</li>

            <h3>Gameplan</h3>

            <ul class="h3-list-margin">
                <li><strong>Be unique: </strong>Avoid generic podcast imagery, such as a microphone, and create something distinct and identifiable</li>

                <li><strong>Future proof: </strong>Focus more towards clean and timeless design for brand longevity and stability</li>

                <li><strong>Express personality: </strong>This isn’t a tech company, lean into the energy and charisma of dirt track racing</li>

                <li><strong>Merch-minded: </strong>Racing offers large marketing opportunities; easily translate to  clothing and promotional merchandise that could be showcased in a variety of ways at the racetrack</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Mind Mapping</h3>

            <ul class="style-list italic h3-list-margin">
                <li><strong>Purpose: </strong> By mapping out keywords and attributes associated to the brand/subject matter, design concepts can be connected back to a strategy, grounding design decisions to a targeted theme. </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="margin-10">
              This exercise helped narrow the brand keywords toward <strong>controlled chaos</strong> and <strong>storytelling</strong>, which later influenced the design direction of the wordmark and icon.

        <section class="col col-one-third">
            <h3>Icon Adjustments</h3>

            <p>Attention to detail was given to properly invert the icon, ensuring the flag's outline is always dark and the flag's inside is always light. This goes beyond simply changing the color of the icon, the icon structure needs to be changed to preserve highlights and shadows when color is inverted.</p>

            <p>In this example the icon on the left is filled in with white, and filled in with a dark color on the right. These two different icon variants help maintain visual consistency across both light and dark backgrounds and are optimized for both scenarios.</p>

            <p>If this project were to continue, the next step would be formalizing the design system into lightweight usage guidelines to support additional collaborators and platforms. Additionally, if the podcast grows into producing video content, there is an opportunity to expand the brand's identity through motion design. This project reinforced the importance of designing brand systems with the same precision as product systems — prioritizing scalability, constraints, and long-term use over one-off aesthetics.</p>
